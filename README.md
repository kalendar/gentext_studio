# Generative Textbook Studio

Generative Open Learning Environments or Generative Textbooks (pronounced "goals") are a new kind of tool for learning. Generative Textbooks combine the technical power of generative AI with the participatory power of open education to make learning more affordable, effective, and meaningful. Traditional print and open textbooks can only contain a limited number of explanations, examples, and other learning activities. Generative Textbooks provide learners with a near infinite number of highly effective explanations, examples, and other learning activities by combining:

* open weights generative AI models, 
* open content for context augmentation, and 
* openly licensed learning activity prompts. 

Generative Textbook Studio is a no-code, open source tool allowing (1) students to learn with Generative Textbooks and (2) instructors, instructional designers, students, and others to create Generative Textbooks. 

Generative Textbooks are described in more detail in the following articles (in which Generative Textbooks were previously called OELMs):
