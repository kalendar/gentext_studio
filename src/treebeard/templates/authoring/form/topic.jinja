            Provide a detailed exposition of the knowledge and skills learners
            need to develop. This content will not be shown to learners. The
            purpose of this material is to provide the LLM with the information
            it needs to provide accurate responses during its interaction with
            learners. This content should read more like a detailed chapter
            summary and less like an entire textbook chapter. If your work is
            based on an existing OER textbook chapter, you might consider using
            AI to draft a summary. You might consider including a list of key
            vocabulary and definitions. You can reference this content in
            Activity Prompts as the information enclosed in the &lt;content&gt;
            tag.
