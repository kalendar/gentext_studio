# 📌 Generative Textbook Studio Roadmap

_Last Updated: 15 April 2025_

💬 **Community Discussions:** [Discord](https://discord.gg/vSPvgyVxJ7)

## 🎯 Vision Statement

Generative textbooks combine the technical power of generative AI with the participatory power of open education to make learning more affordable, effective, and meaningful. While the first generative textbooks will access LLMs running in the cloud, eventually generative textbooks will also run locally on learners' devices.

## 🚀 Roadmap Overview

We welcome contributions — whether it's code, documentation, or ideas! If you're interested, check out our **[Guide to Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)** below.
