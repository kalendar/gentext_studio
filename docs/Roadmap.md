# 📌 GOLE Studio Roadmap
_Last Updated: 15 April 2025_

💬 **Community Discussions:** [Discord](https://discord.gg/vSPvgyVxJ7)  

## 🎯 Vision Statement
Generative open learning environments (GOLEs) combine the technical power of generative AI with the participatory power of open education to make learning more affordable, effective, and meaningful. While the first GOLEs will access LLMs running in the cloud, eventually GOLEs will run locally on learners' devices.

## 🚀 Roadmap Overview
We welcome contributions — whether it's code, documentation, or ideas! If you're interested, check out our **[Guide to Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)** below.  

### ✅ Completed
🎉 Features we've shipped!  
- Mobile-first UI for studying and learning with GOLEs
- Sharing learning activity transcripts
- No-code authoring including system prompt stub, open content for context augmentation, and learning activity prompts for creating GOLEs
- GOLE metadata including authors, peer reviewers, and sources (e.g., for attributing OER)
- Importing and exporting GOLEs between instances of GOLE Studio
- Flexible access to a wide range of open weights models via the [Groq API](https://groq.com/)
- Login with GitHub
