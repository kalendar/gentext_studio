## Essential Concepts

- The **median** of a data set can be computed by ordering the data values and identifying the value in the middle.
- The **mean** represents the balance point of the data, while the **median** represents the 50th percentile, or the value that splits the data in half.
- **Steps to calculate standard deviation by hand:**
  1. Calculate the mean of the population or sample.
  2. Take the difference between each data value and the mean, then square each difference.
  3. Add up all the squared differences.
  4. Divide by either the total number of observations (for a population) or by 1 fewer than the total (for a sample).
  5. Take the square root of the result from step 4.
- **Variability** can be judged from a histogram by examining how far the bars are from the statistical center (mean or median).
  - High variability: Taller bars appear further from the center.
  - Low variability: Data is clustered around the center.
- **Range** measures variability but only considers two observations. It should be used with other measures of spread.
- The **median** remains relatively stable even if an extreme value changes significantly, while the **mean** is more sensitive to extreme values.
- When a distribution is **symmetric**, the mean and median are the same. In skewed distributions:
  - **Right-skewed:** The mean is greater than the median.
  - **Left-skewed:** The mean is less than the median.
- A **boxplot** provides a five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum) and helps visualize skew, outliers, and quartiles.
- **Interquartile range (IQR)** is the best method for determining outliers:
  - Outliers fall outside **Q1 - 1.5(IQR)** or **Q3 + 1.5(IQR)**.
- **Standardizing a value**:
  - Subtract the mean from the value and divide by the standard deviation.
  - A **z-score** represents how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.
- **Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)** applies to bell-shaped, unimodal distributions:
  - **68%** of observations fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
  - **95%** fall within 2 standard deviations.
  - **99.7%** fall within 3 standard deviations.

## Key Equations

**Converting values into standardized scores:**
\[
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\]
where:
- \(x\) = observed value,
- \(\mu\) = population mean,
- \(\sigma\) = population standard deviation.

**Deviation from the mean:**
\[
(x - \bar{x})
\]
where:
- \(x\) = observation,
- \(\bar{x}\) = sample mean.

**Interquartile range (IQR):**
\[
Q3 - Q1
\]

**Lower outlier threshold:**
\[
Q1 - 1.5(IQR)
\]

**Upper outlier threshold:**
\[
Q3 + 1.5(IQR)
\]

**Mean:**
\[
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum{x}}{n}
\]
where:
- \(\bar{x}\) = mean,
- \(\sum{x}\) = sum of data values,
- \(n\) = number of values.

**Standard deviation (population):**
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x - \mu)^2}{n}}
\]

**Standard deviation (sample):**
\[
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}
\]

**Variance (population):**
\[
\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x - \mu)^2}{n}
\]

**Variance (sample):**
\[
s^2 = \frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}
\]

## Glossary

**Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)**  
Predicts the percentage of observations within a certain number of standard deviations in a normal distribution.

**First quartile (Q1)**  
The value below which 25% of the data lies.

**Five-number summary**  
Includes the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum.

**Interquartile range (IQR)**  
Measures variability: \( Q3 - Q1 \).

**Left-skewed (negative skew)**  
Most data is bunched on the right with a "tail" on the left.

**Lower outlier**  
An observation below \( Q1 - 1.5(IQR) \).

**Mean**  
The sum of all values divided by the number of values.

**Median**  
The middle value of an ordered data set.

**Outlier**  
A value significantly different from the rest of the data.

**Range**  
The difference between the maximum and minimum values.

**Right-skewed (positive skew)**  
Most data is bunched on the left with a "tail" on the right.

**Standard deviation**  
A measure of how spread out data is.

**Standardized value (z-score)**  
The number of standard deviations an observation is from the mean.

**Symmetric distribution**  
The left and right sides mirror each other.

**Third quartile (Q3)**  
The value below which 75% of the data lies.

**Upper outlier**  
An observation above \( Q3 + 1.5(IQR) \).

**Variance**  
The standard deviation squared.
