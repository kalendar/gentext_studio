## Essential Concepts

- **Experimental design** refers to the structure of an experiment (a specific type of research method). The primary goal of an experiment is to provide evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables.
- In an **experimental study**, the **factor of interest** (also known as the **explanatory variable** or **independent variable**) is the factor that the researcher purposely changes or manipulates to see if it impacts a specific outcome.
- The **treatments** are the different levels of the factor of interest (or explanatory variable) you are changing. The group that receives the treatment is commonly called the **experimental group**. The group that does not receive the treatment is usually called the **control group**.
- The **response variable** (also known as the **dependent variable**) is an objective measure of the research question that is measured at the end of an experiment and compared across the different levels of the factor of interest (or explanatory variable).
- **Nuisance factors** are factors that are kept the same across all levels of the factor or are explicitly controlled in the experimental design. These factors are not of interest in the study but may affect a change in the response variable.
- To ensure that there are no unexpected differences between the experimental and control groups, good experimental design uses **random assignment** to determine which participants are in each group.
- **Replication** helps ensure that the results of an experiment are truly caused by the change in the factor of interest and not by other hidden factors or natural variation in data.
- The single object or individual to be measured in the experiment is called an **experimental unit**.
- A **placebo** is a harmless version of the treatment that does not contain any active ingredients (e.g., a sugar pill). The **placebo effect** is a positive response that people who believe they are receiving treatment for a condition have, even if what they are actually receiving is a placebo.
- **Blinding** refers to nondisclosure of the treatment an experimental unit is receiving. When neither the subject nor those having contact with the subject know the treatment assignment, the study is called **double-blind**.
- A **block** is a group of subjects that are similar, but blocks differ in ways that might affect the outcome of the experiment. **Blocking** describes the grouping together of homogeneous (similar) experimental units followed by the random assignment of the experimental units within each group to a treatment.
- In an **observational study**, a researcher observes an outcome without changing who is and who is not exposed to some sort of treatment.
- A **confounding variable** is a variable that was not accounted for in a study and may actually influence other variables in a study.
