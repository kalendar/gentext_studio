## Essential Concepts
* Probability is a measure that is associated with how certain we are of outcomes of a particular experiment or activity.

* A chance experiment involves making observations in situations where there is uncertainty about which of two or more possible outcomes will result.

* The sample space of a chance experiment is the collection of all possible outcomes for the experiment.

* We are often interested in the likelihood of a particular outcome (or collection of outcomes) for a chance experiment. An outcome or collection of outcomes for a chance experiment is called an event. The probability of an event is a numeric measure of how likely it is for the event to happen.

* For a chance experiment in which outcomes of the sample space are equally likely, the probability of an event is the number of outcomes in the event divided by the number of possible outcomes in the sample space.

* Theoretical probability is the probability that an event will happen based on pure mathematics, not by carrying out an experiment. The probability estimated from a chance experiment is called an empirical probability. The theoretical probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur in the long run.

* Facts about probabilities:
* The probability of a certain event (an event that will happen) is equal to [latex]1[/latex].
* The probability of an impossible event is equal to [latex]0[/latex]. This means that there are no possible outcomes for that event.
* Probabilities range from [latex]0[/latex] to [latex]1[/latex], including [latex]0[/latex] and [latex]1[/latex]. So, for any event [latex]\text{A}[/latex], [latex]0\leq P(\text{A})\leq1[/latex].
* Probabilities can be expressed as decimals, fractions, or percentages.

* The Law of Large Numbers says that as we increase the number of times we repeat a chance experiment, the closer we can expect the empirical probability calculated from our chance experiment to be to the true probability.

* The complement of event [latex]A[/latex] is denoted [latex]A'[/latex] (read "[latex]A[/latex] prime") or [latex]A^c[/latex] (read "[latex]A[/latex] complement"). The complement of the event [latex]A[/latex] consists of all outcomes that are NOT in [latex]A[/latex].

* AND ([latex]\cap[/latex]) means that both events must happen.

* An outcome is in the event [latex]A[/latex] OR [latex]B[/latex] if the outcome is in [latex]A[/latex] or is in [latex]B[/latex] or is in both [latex]A[/latex] and [latex]B[/latex].

* Probability Properties:
* For any two events, [latex]A[/latex] and [latex]B[/latex]: [latex]P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)[/latex]
* Two events are mutually exclusive if the probability that they both happen at the same time is zero. That is, if events [latex]A[/latex] and [latex]B[/latex] are mutually exclusive, then [latex]P(A \ \mathrm{and} \ B) = 0[/latex].
* Therefore, [latex]P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) + P(B) - 0 = P(A) + P(B)[/latex]

* Sometimes, there are pairs of events for which one event has no effect on the probability of another event occurring. When this is the case, we say the events are independent:
* Events [latex]A[/latex] and [latex]B[/latex] are independent if [latex]P(A \text{ GIVEN } B) = P(A)[/latex]

* If two events are mutually exclusive, that means they cannot happen at the same time with a single outcome. Two events are mutually exclusive if the probability of both events happening at the same time is zero.

* A conditional probability is calculated based on the assumption that one event has already occurred. Conditional probabilities restrict the total.

* Sometimes, there are pairs of events for which one event has no effect on the probability of another event occurring. When this is the case, we say the events are independent.

## Key Equations

**complement of an event**

[latex]P[/latex]([latex]A[/latex]) + [latex]P[/latex](not [latex]A[/latex]) = [latex]1[/latex]

or

[latex]P[/latex]([latex]A[/latex]) + [latex]P[/latex]([latex]A'[/latex]) = [latex]1[/latex]

or

[latex]P[/latex](not [latex]A[/latex]) = [latex]1[/latex] - [latex]P[/latex]([latex]A[/latex])

**independent events**

[latex] P(A) \times P(B) = P(A \text{ and } B)[/latex], [latex] P(A \text{ GIVEN } B) = P(A)[/latex]

**mutually exclusive events**

[latex]P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) + P(B) - 0 = P(A) + P(B)[/latex]

**probability equation**

[latex]P(\text{event}) = \dfrac{\text{number of outcomes in event}}{\text{number of all possible outcomes}}[/latex]

**probability property**

for any two events, [latex]A[/latex] and [latex]B[/latex], [latex]P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)[/latex]
