**Retrieval Practice** is a powerful learning technique where you actively recall information from memory, like answering quiz questions or summarizing what youâ€™ve learned without looking at notes. **Research shows that this strategy is one of the most effective ways to strengthen long-term memory and improve understanding**. Retrieving information helps your brain organize and store it more effectively than rereading or highlighting. And students who frequently quiz themselves tend to perform better on tests compared to those who only review notes. Retrieval practice works best when done regularly and spaced out over time.
