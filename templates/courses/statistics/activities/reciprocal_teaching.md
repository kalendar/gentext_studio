**Reciprocal Teaching** is a way to study where students do four main things: summarize, ask questions, clarify confusing parts, and predict what might come next. Research shows this method helps students understand what they read and think more critically. Summarizing helps focus on the main ideas, questioning digs deeper into the text, clarifying clears up anything confusing, and predicting ties ideas to what might happen later. **Studies show reciprocal teaching is great for improving reading skills because it teaches students how to check their understanding and learn better strategies**. It also builds confidence, making it a great way to handle tough readings or new topics.
